The project has been done in Python3.8.9 and Django. 
Base dir is ~/parking dir where virtual env is activated and all other dirs and files are located. Sqlite3 is used to store all data. 
- Go to folder ./parking/
- And activate virtual env: $source ./bin/activate
- run: $pip install -r requirements.txt
- Change dir to ParkingAPI:  $cd ParkingAPI/

""""
Not sure if those two commands are required as models and data are already migrated
$ python manage.py makemigrations BookingApp
$python manage.py migrate BookingApp
"""

- And run server: $python manage.py runserver
The server will start at localhost port 8000 (http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

To test all requirements, there is Postman collection in separate folder.
GET request to get all boking for a given date (example "BookingDate": "2022-06-01")
POST requests - to book a parking bay if all requirements are satisfied
	     - examples where a customer is rejected if some of the requiremnts is not satisfied
	     
Some assumtions also have been made:
- A customer will send only valid data to book a parking - valid date format, name as a string and license plate as a string ( so no check have been done here)
